                    From May 17 to 19, the Fifth Metropolitan Congress on Modeling and Numerical Simulation was held at the Faculty of Sciences of the UNAM, where students, professors and researchers converged to learn more about this topic and establish lines of multidisciplinary work.
<br>
At the meeting, organized by doctors Josué Tago Pacheco, from Engineering; Úrsula Iturrarán Viveros, from Sciences, and Patricia Domínguez Soto, from the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla, attended by academics from UAM, BUAP, the Guanajuato Mathematics Research Center, and from UNAM entities.
<br>
Dr. Josué Tago explained that the main objective is to bring together all those interested in numerical modeling and simulation and motivate them to present their work. "I invited three of my thesis students to show their progress. It is an enriching experience for them."
<br>
In the inaugural speech Numerical Relativity and Gravitational Waves, Miguel Alcubierre, researcher and director of the Institute of Nuclear Sciences, presented some solutions to Einstein's equations, their complexity and the importance of the collision of black holes for astronomy.
<br>
IF students Pablo Crespo Carrillo, Manuel de Jesús Aguilar Velázquez and Marco Antonio Noguez Morales presented Calculation of Arrival Times Using Finite Differences, Linear Inversion of Phase Velocity Dispersion Curves for Surface Waves and Mathematical and Computational Modeling of Air Pollution. aquifers, respectively.
<br>
Dr. Tago Pacheco invited the FI professors to participate in this meeting and share their projects, since numerical modeling and simulation are essential tools in scientific research and engineering.
