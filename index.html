                        Hello! I am <span>Pablo</span>, a geophysicist
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        With many years of education and now working in the energy industry, I've gone through several phases in my <a href="experience.html" target="_blank">career</a>, clearly
                        defining my compass of values. I am passionate about my work, and I'm always looking to take on new challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In <em>February 2019</em>, with a Bachelor's Degree in Geophysical Engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico
                        and experience in the energy and mining sectors, I moved to Australia to continue developing my professional skills
                        by completing the Master of Science in Geophysics at Curtin University. In <em>February 2021</em>, after two years of hard
                        work, I graduated with distinction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 2016, I've been involved in various mining and energy exploration projects, both as a student and professional,
                        in Mexico and Australia. Some of these include activities
                        in a gold mine in the Mexican desert, looking for production opportunities in mature oilfields in Mexico, and technical analysis of onshore and
                        offshore reservoirs in Australia for hydrocarbon and geothermal purposes.
                        I invite you to discover more <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">here</a> or download my resume below.
